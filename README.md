git-diff-playground
===================
### Notes
- Currently this repo only demostrates diffing and apply patch on textual file using git
- patch file can only be applied to a source file of expected content (to ensure not to break code in real life)
- `file.txt` should not be added to `.gitignore` because it needs to be staged for git diffing
